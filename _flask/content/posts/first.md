American-style dates, I know, I know. Here you can write markdown code, including *italics*. Heck others don't work

You can have:

- Lists
  - test 2
	- test 3
* More Lists
       - test 4
       - yay

> And block quotes

    And event highlighted code if you indent :)

```py
def f1(i):
    return i*i

def f2(f, i):
    return f(i)

print(f1, i)
```
